# OneWire
Library for Dallas/Maxim 1-Wire Chips

This is a fork of [Paul Stoffregen's OneWire library](https://github.com/PaulStoffregen/OneWire)
plus [Piotr Stolarz's patches](https://github.com/pstolarz/OneWire)
from [pull request 8](https://github.com/PaulStoffregen/OneWire/pull/8).
See [Maxim Integrated AN937](http://pdfserv.maximintegrated.com/en/an/AN937.pdf).

It works on my 8 bit AVR chips and I think it is safer.
Should the changes be accepted upstream or Piotr start merging Paul's changes my repo will no longer be needed.
